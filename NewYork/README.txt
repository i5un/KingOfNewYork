General:
	To test this portion of the project, simply include the nessasary drivers into the project and make sure to exclude
	all the other ones. 

	Each part of the assignment is written in a way that requires minimal interaction. Enter the appropriate response when
	prompted. Some error/exception handling have been implemented. 

	Most of the features have been implemented.

Assignment Part 4:
	To test the dice rolling facility, a few required steps must be done in order for it to function properly.

Assignment Part 5:
	The driver simply constructs the buildings and call the "Shuffle method" right after. Energy cubes are simply stored as 
	an integer inside the Player class. 

	Token class has been written but without any implementation detail
